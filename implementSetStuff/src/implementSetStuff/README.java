~Introduction~
	This project implements 11 coding bat problems (created by Mr. Kuzsmaul, which can be found at the link:
http://codingbat.com/home/201718palycs@gmail.com/setstuff), demonstrating my ability to complete AP level computer 
science problems as well as my understanding of each method through simple implementation. 

~How this fulfills / does not fulfill the specification~
	This project fullfills the specifications to write each setstuff coding bat method within a Java class  
and afterwards implement each method to demonstrate my understanding. 

~Explanation of current errors (or anything that falls short of project specifications) and how you might fix them~
	Each of my methods succeeded in passing the tests created on coding bat. However, I was still uncertain that 
my methods could pass every single test every created, so I tested them further. Each method still functioned properly.

~Overview of the code explaining, in broad strokes, the structure of it~
	The main method in this code provides detailed examples of the methods implemented by the setStuff 
coding bat problems. Further down in the code, the methods themselves can be seen commented and coded effectively. 

~Discussion of major challenges encountered in the process of making the code~
	One major challenge I encountered was that once while working on a coding bat problem, I was careless, and 
accidentally reloaded the page, causing myself to lose all of the code I had made, needing to re-do it from scratch.
However, in the long run, re-doing the problem only helped my programming skills and understanding. Additionally, 
on two of the final coding bat problems given, I got stuck and could not figure out how to solve them. Ria Vora kindly 
assisted me - not providing me with direct answers - but rather showing me the flaws in my code and what my code was
actually doing. Overall, these challenges only helped me improve my coding abilities. 

~Acknowledgments (who helped you, what resources you used etc.)~
	I would like to acknowledge my teacher, Mr. Kuzsmaul, who wrote the explanations and test code for each of the 
methods on coding bat that are implemented in this class. In addition, I would also like to give thanks to my friend 
and classmate, Ria Vora, who helped me at times when I was stuck, figure out solutions to the methods we were asked 
to create (one such method was the 'nearestUnvisitedNode', which at first was confusing however once she explained 
it to me the solution was clear).
